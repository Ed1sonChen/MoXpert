# A Multi-Expert Framework for Enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Industrial Anomaly Detection

This is the official implementation of paper "A Multi-Expert Framework for Enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Industrial Anomaly Detection".

> Zhiling Chen*, Farhad Imani.

We propose an multi-experts framework named MoXpert, which comprises four expert modules working together to guide open source MLLMs to improve industrial anomaly detection.
